Drug discovery is one of the most dynamic and exciting areas where AI is making a significant impact. There are constant new developments. Here are some of the most prominent trends and recent advancements in AI-driven drug discovery:\n\n**1. Generative AI for Novel Molecule Design:**\n*   **What it is:** Instead of just analyzing existing molecules, generative AI models can *create* entirely new molecular structures with desired properties. These models learn the \"language\" of chemistry and can propose novel compounds that have never been synthesized before.\n*   **Recent Developments:** Companies are using deep learning models (like GANs and VAEs) to design molecules optimized for specific targets, improved binding affinity, reduced toxicity, or better pharmacokinetic properties. This is moving beyond simply identifying existing compounds to *inventing* new ones.\n*   **Example:** AI is being used to design novel antibodies, small molecules, and even peptides from scratch for various diseases.\n\n**2. Enhanced Target Identification and Validation:**\n*   **What it is:** AI excels at sifting through massive biological datasets (genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, literature) to identify novel drug targets that play a crucial role in disease. It can uncover complex biological pathways and pinpoint proteins or genes that are good candidates for therapeutic intervention.\n*   **Recent Developments:** AI is helping researchers understand disease mechanisms at a deeper level, identifying targets that might have been overlooked by traditional methods. This includes uncovering targets for rare diseases or complex conditions like neurodegenerative disorders.\n*   **Example:** AI can analyze patient data to identify genetic mutations associated with a disease and then predict which proteins are disrupted, suggesting them as potential drug targets.\n\n**3. Predictive Modeling for Efficacy and Toxicity:**\n*   **What it is:** AI algorithms can predict how effective a drug candidate will be and its potential side effects *before* costly and time-consuming lab experiments or clinical trials. This is done by analyzing data from previous drug trials, chemical properties, and biological interactions.\n*   **Recent Developments:** More sophisticated AI models are achieving higher accuracy in predicting ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, Toxicity) properties, helping to de-risk drug candidates early in the pipeline. This significantly reduces the failure rate of drugs in later stages.\n*   **Example:** AI can flag a molecule as having a high likelihood of liver toxicity, prompting researchers to abandon it or modify its structure.\n\n**4. Accelerating Pre-clinical and Clinical Trial Design:**\n*   **What it is:** AI can optimize the design of pre-clinical studies and clinical trials by identifying the most suitable patient populations, predicting trial outcomes, and even suggesting optimal dosing regimens.\n*   **Recent Developments:** AI is being used to create \"synthetic control arms\" in clinical trials, reducing the need for large placebo groups. It also helps in patient stratification to ensure trials enroll individuals most likely to benefit from the drug.\n*   **Example:** AI can analyze electronic health records to identify patients who meet specific criteria for a trial, speeding up recruitment.\n\n**5. Repurposing Existing Drugs:**\n*   **What it is:** AI can scan vast databases of existing drugs and their known effects, along with disease mechanisms, to identify drugs that might be effective for treating entirely new conditions. This is a much faster and cheaper route to new therapies.\n*   **Recent Developments:** AI platforms are constantly finding new potential uses for FDA-approved drugs for various diseases, offering a quicker path to treatment for patients.\n*   **Example:** AI might identify an existing heart medication that could also be effective in treating a specific type of cancer by analyzing its interaction with cellular pathways.\n\n**Specific News and Examples you might see:**\n\n*   **Companies like Atomwise, Exscientia, Recursion Pharmaceuticals, and Insilico Medicine** are consistently announcing breakthroughs in using AI to discover new drug candidates for diseases like cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and rare genetic disorders.\n*   **Partnerships:** You'll often see news about large pharmaceutical companies partnering with AI-focused biotech firms to leverage their AI platforms for drug discovery.\n*   **Specific Drug Candidates:** Companies are starting to bring AI-discovered and designed drugs into clinical trials. News often highlights these advancements.\n*   **AI for Protein Folding (like AlphaFold):** While not directly drug *discovery*, breakthroughs in predicting protein structures with AI (like DeepMind's AlphaFold) are foundational. Knowing the 3D structure of a disease-related protein is critical for designing molecules that can bind to it and modulate its function.\n\nIn summary, AI is not just a tool in drug discovery anymore; it's becoming a fundamental driver of innovation, enabling researchers to explore chemical space more broadly, predict outcomes more accurately, and ultimately bring new therapies to patients faster.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're referring to the second development I mentioned: **Enhanced Target Identification and Validation** in drug discovery. This is a crucial, yet often less visible, step in bringing new medicines to market.\n\nHere's a deeper dive into what it entails and why AI is so transformative in this area:\n\n**The Traditional Challenge of Target Identification:**\n\nBefore you can even think about designing a drug, you need to identify what biological entity (usually a protein or gene) is causing or contributing to a disease. This \"target\" is what your drug will interact with to produce a therapeutic effect.\n\nTraditionally, this process was:\n\n*   **Slow and Laborious:** It involved extensive lab experiments, hypothesis-driven research, and often serendipity.\n*   **Limited by Human Knowledge:** Researchers were constrained by what was already known and understood about complex biological systems.\n*   **Prone to Failure:** Many identified targets turned out to be irrelevant to the disease or too difficult to drug effectively.\n\n**How AI Revolutionizes Target Identification and Validation:**\n\nAI excels at processing and finding patterns within massive, complex datasets that humans simply cannot manage. In target identification, this means AI can:\n\n1.  **Integrate and Analyze Diverse Biological Data:**\n    *   **Genomics:** Analyzing DNA sequences to find mutations linked to disease.\n    *   **Transcriptomics:** Studying RNA to understand which genes are active and at what levels.\n    *   **Proteomics:** Investigating the proteins present in cells and tissues.\n    *   **Metabolomics:** Examining small molecules involved in metabolism.\n    *   **Electronic Health Records (EHRs):** Identifying patient populations with specific conditions and correlating them with other biological data.\n    *   **Scientific Literature:** \"Reading\" and understanding millions of research papers to find connections and hypotheses.\n\n2.  **Uncover Hidden Biological Pathways and Networks:**\n    *   Diseases rarely stem from a single isolated problem. They involve intricate networks of interacting molecules and pathways. AI can map these complex interactions, revealing novel nodes (potential targets) or critical junctions within these pathways that are dysregulated in disease.\n    *   **Example:** An AI might find that a specific protein, not previously associated with Alzheimer's, is upregulated in a subset of patients and is a key regulator in a newly discovered inflammatory pathway contributing to neurodegeneration.\n\n3.  **Identify Novel Targets for \"Undruggable\" Diseases:**\n    *   Many diseases, particularly complex ones like certain cancers or neurodegenerative disorders, have historically lacked good drug targets. AI can help identify targets within these complex biological landscapes that might have been previously overlooked or deemed too challenging.\n\n4.  **Prioritize and Validate Potential Targets:**\n    *   Once potential targets are identified, AI can help rank them based on predicted druggability, relevance to disease progression, and potential for therapeutic intervention.\n    *   It can also help in the validation process by predicting the likely impact of modulating that target, often by simulating its role in cellular processes.\n\n5.  **Personalize Target Identification:**\n    *   AI can analyze patient-specific data to identify targets that are relevant to *individual* patients or specific patient subgroups, paving the way for more precision medicine approaches.\n\n**Recent News and Examples:**\n\n*   **\"Digital Twins\" of Diseases:** Researchers are using AI to build computational models that mimic specific diseases, allowing them to \"test\" different interventions and identify key targets within these virtual disease environments.\n*   **AI for Rare Diseases:** For rare genetic disorders where patient populations are small, AI can analyze limited genomic data more effectively to pinpoint the underlying molecular cause and thus, the target.\n*   **Identifying new cancer drivers:** AI is helping oncologists and researchers uncover previously unknown genetic mutations or protein interactions that drive tumor growth, opening up new avenues for targeted therapies.\n*   **Drug developers are increasingly publishing research on AI-driven target identification platforms.** These platforms often claim to accelerate the discovery of novel targets by several orders of magnitude compared to traditional methods.\n\n**Why is this so important?**\n\nA well-identified and validated target is the foundation of successful drug development. If you start with a faulty target, your entire pipeline is at risk. AI significantly increases the probability of finding the *right* targets from the outset, saving immense time, resources, and ultimately, bringing more effective treatments to patients.\n\nThis development is crucial because it addresses a fundamental bottleneck in the entire drug discovery process. By providing a more robust and data-driven approach to finding targets, AI is fundamentally reshaping how we approach developing new medicines.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking a great question, as the landscape of AI in drug discovery is populated by a mix of established pharmaceutical giants and agile, specialized AI-first biotech companies.\n\nFor **Enhanced Target Identification and Validation**, here are some of the key players, categorized for clarity:\n\n**1.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer.

This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
